# SmartPad++ - SOEN6751 Winter 2018 Final Project

This program demonstrates conceptual interface improvements to NotePad++.

- Reactive interface based on user type
- Commands can be selected from a searchable "all commands" panel
- After commands are executed they appear in a "recent commands" drop down providing 
quick access to the command for the user.

## Technology
This project uses the same core as NetPad++, Scintilla, however it's interface is built
using C# Forms for Windows.

To bootstrap the project we used the open-source Scintilla.net.Demo project. 

## Running the Project
Download Visual Studio 2015+ and open the Solution file. Then use the VS package manager to download the Scintilla.net project.
